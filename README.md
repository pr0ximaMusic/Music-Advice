<h1>PR0XIMA'S MUSIC/ARTIST  ADVICE:</h1>
(Decription): <br>Some vague and preachy tips that I've learned since starting music production only 3 years ago. Take it with an entire salt mine. I don't know shit about fuck, so don't act like I do. These work for me, they may not work for you.

  

## 1. **No matter what, keep at it**
*(self-explanatory)*

## 2. **"What DAW should I use, guys? FL or Ableton? Should I buy XYZ synth/piece of gear? What plugins should I use?"***
The best DAW/Hardware/Gear is the one **you know**, just fucking pick one.
*(Ableton and FL are good options with a lot of community support)*

Learn your DAW/Hardware/Gear inside and out. You can worry about switching to/buying something else if you’ve outgrown your setup. 

***Outgrowing your tools will likely not happen for a while***


## 3. **Artists grow through experience, not tuning one track for their entire lives**
Bounce (*export*) tracks out of your daw frequently, and practice being okay with letting them be what they are.  There's a fine line between being detail-oriented and obsessing over "getting it right" so nobody thinks you suck at music. So what if the track "sucks"? Let the track go, you have  infinitely more creative opportunities to make better ones.

 It’s really easy to operate out of a mindset of creative scarcity. Your creativity does not operate like a disposable vape, fun for a short while, eventually tapped out of tasty juice forever.
Creativity doesn't work like that. In reality, that shit's an infinite well as long as you can let go of your tracks even when they're not perfect. 

***Don't constipate your creativity because you can't let a track be done.*** 

## 4. **Intimidation is an opportunity**
Take every opportunity to learn about a concept when you discover the terminology for it, ***especially*** if it’s intimidating. 

> **For example:** <br>If you don't know what compression is, go find out. 
> Hear someone use the word "saturation"? Never heard of it. Go find out.
> Someone says you're slamming your limiter, but you've never used a limiter in your life.
> GO. FIND. OUT. 

Do this **both** through reading up on it, and also through hands-on exploration in-daw.

  You’ll quickly start to realize that “finding out” is not solely about the specific thing you're learning, it’s about establishing a habit of fostering curiosity and exploration when you're challenged. <br>

***To fuck around is human, to find out is divine.***

 

## 5. **Limitations make the art**

Always challenge yourself on every new track, even if it’s just a small challenge.

It’s like playing a game with specific little rules. When you're starting a new project in Ableton, impose limitations on what you can and can't do this time around. If you can have a goal to explore some production concept each time you open the daw, do it. Even if you don't come in with a concept to explore, you'll find one just dicking around. Hone. in. on. that. shit. 

Make a track with the goal of only having 9 elements MAX. 
Practice spamming sound design ideas.  
Then, do the hard part of _not_ implementing all of those ideas in one track. 
Pick like, 2 of them and ***throw the rest away***

 

## 6. **Comparison and listening to music**

When you are not outputting, input. Intentionally listen to artists making music in your artistic wheelhouse.

 **Sidenote:** If you don’t know your artistic wheelhouse, ask people what artists  your music reminds them of. 
If you have DJ friends: ask their opinion.
If you don’t: **Go find some, you dummy**
 

> *(Ideally, smaller, local DJs spinning the same genre you make)*

***DJs are like librarians, but for music!***
 DJ’s aren’t record spinning robots, they're people with a fanatical love and passion for music that can't be found anywhere else. Respectfully utilize their wisdom.

> *Be kind, connect like a human being, and don't bother them during their sets. Try instagram first*


**So, you've found artists making music in your wheelhouse:** <br> Use their tracks as an A|B (side-by-side) reference comparison with your tracks. 
Ask yourself some questions:
 - What do you hear that's different in the arrangement? 
 - What do you hear that's different in the mix?
 
 ***Practice intentionally making these comparisons without judging or wounding yourself.***
 
Find tracks that feel to you like they have some kind of “secret sauce” quality to them. 

Practice understanding and communicating *IN WORDS* what you think that secret sauce is. Then, start trying to replicate that secret sauce on your own.  

During this process, don't worry about fears like "oh no, does that mean I'm unoriginal?" because I guarantee your originality and creativity will make itself present in your art when attempting to replicate that secret sauce. The originality is baked-in to everything you make like a fingerprint. Your originality is present whether you like it or not.

***YOU LITERALLY CAN’T HELP IT, YOU ARE NOT THEM.*** <br>

 *As a reminder:*

## 7. **YOU. ARE. FUCKING. LEARNING.**
Using the creative gift of taste and comparison to wound and judge yourself (and others) is just a copium-huffing tactic for avoiding the vulnerability that’s mandatory for growth.<br> 
*You've got time, this is a marathon, not a sprint.*

  
<br>

If you can do all that without fucking it up, you're gonna be the best musician that's ever lived.
*(Editor's Note: You're gonna fuck it up.)*
